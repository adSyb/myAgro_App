myAgro Web Application - "How-To" for employees

## Acquiring the App ##

1) The application can be copied from the "myAgro_App" folder in Dropbox. Copy this folder to a location on your own computer. You will run the application from this copied location.

2) Click the file "MyAgro_Application.html". The application will open in your default browser. You do not need an internet connection to use the application.

3) Within the "myAgro_App" folder, there are additional files which may need to be updated periodically. Most importantly, the data folder will need to be updated on a weekly basis. The updated data folder will be available in Dropbox at the beginning of each week, and will be named "data". An email reminder from Grant will be sent when the new data is available in Dropbox.

To update your application, copy the "data" folder from Dropbox and paste it in your own copy of the "myAgro_App" folder. Allow the existing and new "data" folders to merge and the existing files to be replaced.

4) Potentially, the files "MyAgro_Application.html", "global.css", and "js" folder will need to be updated. This will follow the same procedure as updating the data. If an update to these folders is necessary, an email from Grant will be sent.

It is important that you do not update the "Tiles" folder without reason. This folder contains the images for the base map, is very large and will not be updated.

## Application Use ##

-- Layers --

On open, the map is centered south of Bamako and the Villages layer is visible. To add or remove layers, hover over the layers icon (stacked squares) in the top left corner of the map. Checking or unchecking the box will add or remove the respective layer.

The Village layer shows the villages in which myAgro works. Only villages within Mali are included at this time. Newly added villages may not be included. The Agent layer is a created polygon surrounding the villages in which the agent works. It does not represent the geographic area which that particular agent covers, but rather groups the villages they have been assigned. The Zone layer includes the 6 Zones within Mali in which myAgro currently works.

There is a seperate layer to add and remove the village labels. To view the label for an Agent or Zone, hover over the feature with the mouse.

At this time, the order in which layers are added determines which layer is at the top, and therefore easily clickable. For example, if you would like the Villages and Agents layers to appear, first add the Agents layer, then the Villages layer, in order to be able to click the villages. To bring a layer to the front of the map, remove the layer, then add it again. This is a known issue to be improved.

-- Zoom --

To zoom in and out, use either the buttons at the top left corner of the map, or a mouse scrollbar.

-- Tabs and Side Pages --

Three tabs are located on the left side of the map: "Payment Tracking", "Packet View", and "Distances". Clicking a tab will open the respective side page.

The "Close" button will close the side page, but will retain the charts and representation selected. The "Reset" button will clear the charts and the variable representation on the map.

-- Representation --

To change the representation of the Villages, Agents or Zones on the map, open either the Payment Tracking or Packet View tabs. The dropdown menu at the top of either of these tabs can be used to select a variable to view on the map. Selecting "-- None --" will return the layers to their default representation.

-- Legend --

After selecting a variable to represent on the map, the legend will appear on the right side of the map. At this time, three legends appear; for the Zone, Agent and Village layers. The legend will change when a new variable is selected from the dropdown menu.

-- Charts --

To view the chart for a Zone, Agent or village, click once on the feature. Either the Packet View or Payment Tracking tab must be open. It is then possible to alternate between both tabs to view the chart for the selected feature.

There are two charts under the Payment Tracking tab. The first, CFA Goals and Progress, indicates the amount of CFA enrollment as well as payment progress. Along the X-axis, the amount in CFA is given. The Y-axis gives the group, beginning at the top with the total for the selected feature, then broken down into Male producers, small and large Male producers, Female producers, and small and large Female producers. The end of the light blue bar indicates the enrolled CFA amount for the respective group. The dark blue bar indicates the payment progress of that group. The written percentage next to the dark blue bar indicates the percent of the enrolled CFA goal which has been paid.

The second chart indicates the number of clients within the selected feature, as well as the percentage of clients who have finished at least one packet. The X-axis indicates the number of clients and the Y-axis indicates the group, beginning at the top with total, then broken down into Male and Female producers.

Under the Packet View tab, a sunburst chart indicates the break-down of enrolled packets for the selected feature. Hovering over a section of the chart with the mouse will open a pop-up with the exact count of packets. The middle of the chart (gray) represents all packets. The first ring breaks down the packets into Corn, Peanut, Vegetable and Semoir. The second ring breaks down Corn, Peanut and Vegetable packets into Male and Female enrollments. The Semoir packets are broken down into Semoir (machinery) and Semoir Service packets. The third ring breaks down the Corn and Peanut, Male and Female packets into small and large producers.

Clicking on a sub-section of the sunburst chart will 'zoom' the chart. For example, clicking on the Peanut section will place Peanuts in the middle of the chart, and only the break down of Peanut packets will be shown. To zoom back out, click the middle of the chart.

-- Distance Tab --

The distance tab provides a tool to view the straight-line distance between neighboring villages. Open the tab and click on a village to use the tool. All villages within 10 kilometers of the clicked village will be printed in a list, along with the distance from the clicked village. Straight lines between the clicked village and the neighbors will be drawn on the map.
